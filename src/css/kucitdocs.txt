0. Syntax

a style is defined by 

"basestyle"-"parameter1"-"parameter2"

each code breakage uses strip "-"


1 . Margins and Padding

to make a margin you have to use the keyword "m" followed 
with custom or direct margin pixel

examples :

<div class = "m-10"> this will have 10px margin anywhere </div>
<div class = "m-top-100"> this will have 100px margin top  </div>
<div class = "m-right-10"> this will have 10px margin right  </div> 

This applies to padding as well 
the keyword for padding is "p"

2 . Flexboxes

flexboxes are containers of elements
